Service Observability Stack for Kubernetes
(Istio + OpenTelemetry + Tempo + Loki + Prometheus + Grafana)
Executive Summary
To enhance visibility, reliability, and performance of our microservices-based applications running on Kubernetes, we are deploying an open-source observability stack tailored for service mesh debugging, metrics, logs, and tracing. This stack will be installed on our on-premise infrastructure to reduce cloud costs and ensure compliance with data security requirements critical for our healthcare domain.
Why This Matters for Us (Health Insurance Organization)
- Regulatory Compliance: Full control over data via on-premise deployment ensures HIPAA-aligned observability.
- Cost Efficiency: Eliminates dependency on costly third-party SaaS solutions by using fully open-source tooling.
- Improved MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution): Enables fast root cause detection during service degradation or outages.
- 360° Observability: Unifies logs, metrics, and traces across services—critical for complex, distributed health applications.
Stack Components and Benefits
Tool	Purpose	Benefits to Org
Istio	Service Mesh	Secure service-to-service communication (already deployed)
OpenTelemetry	Collects traces, logs, metrics	Vendor-neutral; integrates with multiple backends
Prometheus	Metrics collection and alerting	Visibility into application and infra performance
Tempo	Distributed tracing backend	Trace user journeys and pinpoint performance bottlenecks
Loki	Log aggregation	Scalable, low-cost centralized logging
Grafana	Dashboards for metrics/traces/logs	Single-pane-of-glass for health of apps and clusters
Deployment Strategy
- Platform: Kubernetes (existing clusters on on-site servers)
- Storage Backend: Using MinIO (S3-compatible) deployed locally
- Configuration: Helm-based installs, automated upgrades
- Dashboards: Istio and app-specific dashboards in Grafana
Expected Outcomes
	Proactive Monitoring: Immediate alerts and historical insights into degraded service performance.
	 Faster Debugging: Correlate logs, traces, and metrics for a single request across services.
	 Infrastructure Insight: Monitor K8s node, pod, and container health in real-time.
	 Cost Control: Avoid recurring SaaS platform charges by leveraging free, open-source software and existing hardware.
All Open-Source, No Licensing Costs
All tools in this stack are Apache 2.0 or MIT licensed, ensuring no licensing burden and complete ownership over our observability pipeline.
